# My-SchedUP
## With this web app you can make, print or download your schedule in a simple and elegant way.

<h4>How it works</h4>
<ol>
  <li><b>To access to make your schedule, you need to register.</b> <br>This is because it will be saved in a database, so you can check it anywhere.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Once you're login you can access to the "My Schedup".</b> <br>Here you can add your subjects, delete them, print them and download them.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>You can change your name or delete your account on the main page.</b> <br>Just click your name and it'll show a window with these actions.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>If you want to skip all this and try it inmediatly, you can log in as guest@email and password: 123456789.</b></li>
</ol>
<br>
*NOTE: There's no validation on the emails accounts but the password are encrypted so don't worry about it.
